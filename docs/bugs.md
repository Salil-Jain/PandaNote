# Bug Tracking

This document will hold all the bugs and solutions that I encounter during the development of the this project. Some of them will be small while others might affect the whole project.

#### Creating to wrong controllers
**Issue:** While creating controllers from the command line I mistakenly added one that wasn't under API and one that wasn't plural.
**Correction:** I deleted the files, then committed. After committing I realized that I had missed some files. Four or five times of that process and now I am pretty sure there are no extra files.
